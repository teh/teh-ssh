This a library for implementing your own servers that handle SSH
requests and authorization, etc. Similar to Python's Twisted Conch
library. It's used eg by darcsden to provide basic SSH access.

This package receives only basic maintenance; if you'd like to
take it over, please contact the current maintainer.
